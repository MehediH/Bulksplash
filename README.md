## Quick Start

To use Bulksplash, you need to [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once you have Node.js installed, you can simple use the `npx` command to run Bulksplash:

`npx bulksplash`

This will automatically download and let you use Bulksplash. To be able to use Bulksplash wherever you like, you can install it globally using `npm`:

`npm install bulksplash --g`

Once installed, you can simply run `bulksplash` from the terminal on any folder to download images from Unsplash. 

## What's New

Bulksplash is now [available as an NPM package.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bulksplash)

Bulksplash now lets you download images from Collections. You can view the [Unsplash Collections here](https://unsplash.com/collections), and when using Bulksplash, you can enter any of the available collection links to download all/some images from that collection.

Bulksplash also now automatically generates a `bulksplash-credits.json` file that has the details of the photographers who made their pictures available on Unsplash. 


## Options

Prompts in the terminal will guide you through the options for downloading images, with some default values for quicker use. The prompts are as follows:

* `Which directory do you want to save to?` - The folder you want to download the pictures to. _Defaults to your current directory_
* `Which images do you want to download?` - Whether you want to download images randomly or from a specific collection. _Defaults to random_
* `What search term?` - A search term, or blank for random images. _Defaults to blank_

* `Only featured images?` - Should it only get featured images, curated by Unsplash? _Defaults to `Yes`_
* `What orientation?` - What orientation should the images be? The options are `Mixed`, `Portrait`, `Landscape`, `Squarish`, or `Custom`. `Mixed` will get images regardless of orientation, while `Custom` allows you to choose a specific width and height. _Defaults to `Mixed`_
* `What color?` - What color should the images be? The options are `Any`, `Black and white`, `Black`, `White`, `Yellow`, `Orange`, `Red`, `Purple`, `Magenta`, `Green`, `Teal`, or `Blue`. _Defaults to `Any`_
